\begin{dframe}{Motivation and plan}
  \1 Again talking about \textbf{cloud potential for teaching}\\
     \dots but \textbf{lots has changed} in the last two years, e.g.,

  \2 I now edit \LaTeX{} using Visual Studio Code instead of Emacs
  \2 I finally converted Lech's lecture slide template to Beamer
  
  \medskip

  \1 My plan is to cover two topics:

  \2 Using \textbf{continuous integration} for teaching material
  \2 Potentially adopting \textbf{cloud-based IDEs} for teaching

  \medskip

  \1 Also aim to explain relevance of two changes above!

\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Outgoing CS webserver setup}
  \1 Previously: all \textbf{CS course material} at \url{www.cs.otago.ac.nz}

  \2 Content normally reaches the web care of \url{prism.otago.ac.nz}
  \2 Content usually \textbf{was publicly available}---good!
  \2 Supports dynamic web page content, e.g., using PHP
  
  \3 Security isolation through server design

  \medskip

  \1 Pandemic led to CS \textbf{shift to Blackboard}

  \2 Aim to \textbf{simplify student experience}---important
  \2 Blackboard handles some student/teaching needs OK (?)
  \2 Soon: Blackboard will \textbf{move to cloud}; also \textbf{LMS review}
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{General web technology evolution}
  \1 Typically \textbf{don't need PHP} for simple content hosting

  \2 Dynamic web languages need server execution
  
  \3 Security and maintenance hassle...

  \1 Now common to aim to \textbf{generate static content}

  \2 Works well with content delivery networks (CDNs)
  \2 JavaScript is typically assumed for client-side Automation
  \2 Can include \textbf{dynamic content using \texttt{iframe}s}

  \1 Need something more powerful?
  
  \2 Grab yourself a virtual machine, or \textbf{a container}
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{SSG---Static Site Generaors}
  \1 Move \textbf{application of templates} back to `compile time'

  \2 Run SSG over source code, HTML files produced
  \2 Often Markdown used for source code
  \2 Causes redundant HTML, but not a resource challenge

  \1 Popularised through \textbf{GitHub pages}

  \2 Web serving becomes simple and easy too

  % \3 ... which is why GitHub can do it for free

  \1 Many SSG tools exist, for example:

  \2 \textbf{\href{http://jekyllrb.com}{Jekyll}}---written in Ruby; used by GitHub Pages

  \2 \textbf{Hugo}---written in Go
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{CI---Continuous Integration}
  \1 SSG tools work well with \textbf{continuous integration}, e.g., 

  \2 Update your source content;
  \2 Git commit, Git push;
  \2 CI runs SSG to build HTML;
  \2 HTML passed to webserver
   
  \bigskip
  
  \1 Let's \href{https://altitude.otago.ac.nz/cosc312}{create the website} for a new COSC paper
  
  \2 We'll use Hugo for the static site generation
  \2 \textbf{CS GitLab} at \href{https://altitude.otago.ac.nz/}{\texttt{altitude.otago.ac.nz}} provides \textbf{CI and web server}
 
  \3 Use of GitLab Pages covered in \href{http://cosc212.cspages.otago.ac.nz/LabBook/LabBook.pdf}{COSC212} \& \href{http://cosc202.cspages.otago.ac.nz/lab-book/COSC202LabBook.pdf}{COSC202} lab books
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Jekyll builds Carpentries teaching material}
  \1 The Carpentries promotes \textbf{digital research skills}

  \2 Releases teaching materials as open source via the web
  \2 Uses Jekyll SSG to produce its pages (e.g., GitHub Pages)

  \bigskip

  \1 Carpentries lessons used within COSC202 \& COSC349
  
  \2 \textbf{Unix Shell and Git} are core lessons
  \2 \textbf{Docker} lesson is in the Carpentries Incubator
  
  \bigskip

  \1 Let's build a \textbf{Carpentries lesson website} using Docker
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Visual Studio Code (VSCode)}
  \1 Wanted to move COSC202 to IDE usable broadly
  \1 VSCode development speed has been insanely fast:
  
  \2 compositionality of extensions is extremely impressive
  \2 e.g., I use a code spellcheck extension to spellcheck my \LaTeX{}

  \1 Integrates version control straightforwardly
  
  \2 thus supports Git-driven continuous integration
  
  \1 Many more tricks up its sleeve, since it's an electron application...
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{VSCode and Electron applications}
  \1 Electron applications use a browser to do rendering
  
  \2 Also means they're close to hosting on web

  \bigskip

  \1 Refactoring of VSCode now provides VSCode Server
  
  \2 i.e., you can access VSCode remotely via a web browser
  
  \bigskip

  \1 VSCode already integrated the idea of remote development environments

  \2 e.g., development within software containers, over SSH, etc.
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Codespaces}
  \1 GitHub Codespaces launched in beta in 2020 % TODO

  \2 Provides a means to manage development environments around repositories
  \2 Active rather than the scheduled feel of continuous integration
  \2 but can commit back to repositories to trigger CI

  \bigskip

  \1 Let's use Codespaces to edit lesson from Carpentries
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{BYOD and remote teaching}
 % \1 So we get to the teaching relevance
  \1 Advantage of cloud-based IDEs include:
  
  \2 Can be hosted in the cloud, or onsite, or both
  \2 Students can access the environment on any device
  \2 CS Lab environment or remote: consistent access to software

  \1 Key challenge: GUIs
  
  \2 Not impossible to handle, but typically web is targetted
%  \2 and that doesn't suit all cases

  \1 Very keen to test the practicality of this
  
  \2 May couple well with the CS lab shift to Windows for 2023
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Containers that build \LaTeX{} into PDF}
  % \1 Static websites for openly sharing open source lecture material is a bit niche

  \1 Using \LaTeX{} to make your lecture notes?
  
  \2 Can use CI to share with students the PDFs produced
  \2 Can create Docker container that builds \LaTeX{}
  
  \1 Using VSCode to edit your \LaTeX{}

  \2 Can use online VSCode to update your notes from anywhere

  % \2 Automation efficiency: want compilation of notes to release them on the web too

  \1 Support Blackboard by including PDFs by URL
 
  \2 URLs from Blackboard link to CI-generated PDFs.

  \2 (or just link out to your own static website...)

  % \1 Discuss creating a container that builds content using \LaTeX{}
\end{dframe}

% include SOAP?

\begin{dframe}{Gitpod}
  \1 Codespaces is great, but proprietary
  \1 Gitpod is to Codespaces what GitLab is to GitHub
  
  \2 open source implementation of cloud IDE
  \2 also a hosted service in the cloud

  \1 Originally Gitpod used a VSCode-like editor

  \2 however now `everyone' is using VSCode
  \2 So Gitpod does too
  \2 Gitpod was key in development of VSCode Server
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Git-based web can share large files (LFS)}
  \1 Many ways to share files publicly of different sizes

  \2 e.g., CloudStor, OneDrive(ish), FileDrop, Globus, etc.
  \2 (ITS can advise on the different options)
%  \2 sharing seems to only be for limited times only

  \1 CS website allowed persistent public sharing of files

  \2 but adding transient files to Git not ideal
  \2 `deleted' files will still be in Git history

  \1 GitLab supports Git LFS---i.e., large file support

  \2 Files in Git are instead more like symlinks
  \2 Git LFS organises for large files to be downloaded

  % example of using LFS to share files

\end{frame}

\begin{dframe}{Motivation and plan}
  \1 Again talking about \textbf{cloud potential for teaching}\\
     \dots but \textbf{lots has changed} in the last two years, e.g.,

  \2 I now edit \LaTeX{} using Visual Studio Code instead of Emacs
  \2 I finally converted Lech's lecture slide template to Beamer
  
  \bigskip

  \1 My plan is to cover two topics:

  \2 Using \textbf{continuous integration} for teaching material
  \2 Potentially adopting \textbf{cloud-based IDEs} for teaching

  \bigskip

  \1 Also aim to explain relevance of two changes above!

\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Outgoing CS webserver setup}
  \1 Previously: all CS course material at \url{www.cs.otago.ac.nz}

  \2 Content normally reaches the web care of \url{prism.otago.ac.nz}
  \2 Content usually publicly available---good!
  \2 Supports dynamic web page content, e.g., using PHP
  
  \3 Security isolation through server design

  \medskip

  \1 Pandemic led to CS shift to Blackboard

  \2 Aim to simplify student experience---important
  \2 Blackboard handles some student/teaching needs OK (?)
  \2 Soon: Blackboard will move to cloud; also LMS review
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Web technology evolution}
  \1 Typically don't need PHP for simple content hosting

  \2 Dynamic web languages need server execution
  
  \3 Security and maintenance hassle...

  \1 Now common to seek static content

  \2 Works well with CDNs
  \2 JavaScript is typically assumed for client-side Automation
  \2 Can include dynamic content using \texttt{iframe}s

  \1 Need something powerful? Grab yourself a virtual machine, or a container
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{SSG---Static Site Generaors}
  \1 Move template generation back to compile time

  \2 Run SSG over source code, HTML files produced
  \2 Often Markdown used for source code
  \2 Causes redundant HTML, but not a resource challenge

  \1 Popularised through GitHub pages

  \2 Web serving becomes simple and easy

  % \3 ... which is why GitHub can do it for free

  \1 Many SSG tools exist, for example:

  \2 Jekyll---written in Ruby; used by GitHub Pages

  \2 Hugo---written in Go
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{CI---Continuous Integration}
  \1 SSG tools work well with continuous integration

  \2 You update your source content, commit, push
  \2 CI runs SSG to build HTML
  \2 Install HTML on web server

  \bigskip
  
  \1 This is covered in COSC212 and COSC202
  
  \bigskip

  \1 Demo-wise, let's create the website for a new paper
  
  \2 We'll use GitLab and the Hugo SSG
  % TODO template creation of COSC312
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Jekyll builds Carpentries teaching material}
  \1 The Carpentries promotes digital research skills

  \2 Releases materials as open source

  \bigskip
  
  \1 Runs an incubator for new lesson material
  
  \2 I contributed the Docker lesson
  \2 Have also used in COSC349 and COSC202
  
  \bigskip

  \1 Let's build that lesson using Docker
%  \1 But now can move this entirely into cloud
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Codespaces}
  \1 GitHub Codespaces launched in beta in 2020 % TODO

  \2 Provides a means to manage development environments around repositories
  \2 Active rather than the scheduled feel of continuous integration
  \2 but can commit back to repositories to trigger CI

  \bigskip

  \1 Let's use Codespaces to edit the Docker lab
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Containers with \LaTeX}
  \1 Static websites for openly sharing open source lecture material is a bit niche

  \1 Sharing PDFs of your lecture notes is less so
  
  \2 Automation efficiency: want compilation of notes to release them on the web too

  \1 Support Blackboard by managing URLs that link to statically hosted CI-generated PDFs.

  \2 e.g., in COSC202
  \2 in most of my other papers I still link to the whole paper structure outside Blackboard

  \1 Discuss creating a container that builds content using \LaTeX{}
\end{dframe}

% include SOAP?

\begin{dframe}{VSCode + \LaTeX}
  \1 Wanted to move COSC202 to IDE that could be used broadly
  \1 VSCode development speed has been insane
  
  \2 compositionality is extremely impressive
  \2 e.g., I use a code spellcheck extension to spellcheck my \LaTeX{}

  \1 Integrates version control straightforwardly
  
  \2 thus supports Git-driven continuous integration
  
  \1 Many more tricks up its sleeve, since it's an electron application
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Electron applications}
  \1 Electron applications use a browser to do rendering
  \1 However that means they're not too far from web
  \1 Refactoring of VSCode now provides VSCode Server
  
  \2 i.e., you can access VSCode remotely via a web browser
  \2 VSCode already integrated the idea of remote development environments

  \3 e.g., within software containers, over SSH, etc.
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Gitpod}
  \1 Codespaces is great, but proprietary
  \1 Gitpod is to Codespaces what GitLab is to GitHub
  
  \2 open source implementation of cloud IDE
  \2 also a hosted service in the cloud

  \1 Originally Gitpod used a VSCode-like editor

  \2 however now `everyone' is using VSCode
  \2 So Gitpod does too
  \2 Gitpod was key in development of VSCode Server
\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{Git LFS}
  \1 Prism allowed one to plonk large files online for sharing
  \1 OneDrive / Sharepoint is supposed to support sharing

  \2 It does, provided that you have narrow, corporate definitions
  \2 i.e., content is an office document or near to It
  \2 sharing is for limited times only---nothing should be too open

  \1 ITS can help in many ways, but we're not at self-admin levels yet

  \1 Sharing through GitLab Pages feels wrong---objects shouldn't be in Git
  
  \1 Enter LFS!
  % example of using LFS to share files

\end{dframe}

\begin{dframe}{BYOD and remote teaching}
  \1 So we get to the teaching relevance
  \1 Advantage of cloud-based IDEs include:
  
  \2 Can be hosted in the cloud, or onsite, or both
  \2 Students can access the environment on any device
  \2 Lab environment or remote: good access to consistent software

  \1 Key challenge: GUIs
  
  \2 Not impossible to handle, but typically web is targetted
  \2 and that doesn't suit all cases

  \1 Very keen to test the practicality of this
  
  \2 May couple well with the shift to Windows in the CS labs for 2023

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-gitpod-file
gp init # in Gitpod shell

add into .gitpod.yml
